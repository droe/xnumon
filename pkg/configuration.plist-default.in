       1 * xnumon-stats     agent metrics for in-band health monitoring
       2 * image-exec       a process executed an executable image
       3 * process-access   a process has accessed another process using
                            task_for_pid or ptrace
       4   launchd-add      a process has added or modified a Launch Agent or
                            Launch Daemon plist; incurs file close audit load
       The agent will only monitor the audit events that are needed to produce
       the selected events.  Disabling events that use hotter audit events is
       one way to reduce load.  The events marked with * are recommended to
       keep enabled, disabling them does not result in a significant reduction
       of load.

  <!-- DATA ACQUISITION -->

  <!-- Kernel extension level:
       0 none       Do not use kernel extension.  Processes may execute without
                    any delay, but acquisition of images may fail for processes
                    writing to or unlinking their executable image on disk,
                    resulting in log events without hashes or code signatures.
                    While care has been taken to avoid acquiring wrong hashes
                    or code signatures, there is still a race condition that
                    cannot be avoided without kernel help.  If an executable
                    modifies its executable image after exec, before xnumon
                    receives and processes the audit event and stats the image,
                    then the acquired hash and code signature will be different
                    from the one actually activated during exec.
       1 open       Synchroniously open and stat executable image before the
                    process is allowed to execute in the new image.
                    This incurs only a minimal delay before the new process may
                    execute, but processes writing to their own exec image may
                    cause subsequent hashes and code signature acquisition to
                    fail, resulting in log events without hashes or code
                    signatures.  The acquired hashes and code signature
                    information can never be wrong, only missing.  Processes
                    unlinking but not modifying their own executable image on
                    disk will have hashes acquired successfully.
       2 hashes     Synchroniously acquire hashes of the executable image
                    before the process is allowed to execute in the new image.
                    Incurs a delay of a few milliseconds depending on image
                    size, but ensures we have hashes for all exec images.  For
                    processes modifying or unlinking their own image on disk,
                    the subsequent acquisition of code signature information
                    may fail, resulting in log events without code signatures.
                    The acquired code signature information can never be wrong,
                    only missing.  The delay for hash acquisition is minimal if
                    hashes for the same binary have been cached from a previous
                    execution.
       3 codesign   Synchroniously acquire hashes and code signature info
                    before the process is allowed to execute in the new image.
                    Incurs a significant delay of tens of milliseconds for very
                    small executable images up to hundreds of microseconds for
                    large app bundles, sometimes even seconds (!), but ensures
                    we have both hashes and code signature information for all
                    executed image files.  The delay for hash and code
                    signature info acquisition is minimal if hashes and code
                    signature info for the same binary have been cached from a
                    previous execution.
                    NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.

       The idea is that for Apple-signed binaries, the ident string serves the

  <!-- SUPPRESSIONS -->

  <!-- Suppress image exec events at start:
       If enabled (<true/>), suppress image exec events for processes that were
       already running at the time xnumon started.  If disabled (<false/>),
       produce image exec events for already running processes in order to
       produce a complete view on all processes.  These events are logged
       before the xnumon start event is produced; the xnumon start event always
       marks the beginning of normal operation.  Image execution events that
       were acquired from live running processes instead of audit or kext
       events are marked with an additional "reconstructed" field.  For each
       process forked off the same image execution, a separate image execution
       event is produced, because these are not easily distringuishable.
       Note that setting this option to <false/> also means that when xnumon
       restarts, for example to load a configuration change, as a result of
       manual unloading/loading of the launchd plist or because the kext kills
       the userspace daemon due to having become unresponsive, an image exec
       event will be logged for every running process.  The process images will
       be acquired in any case in order to provide context for later events,
       this option only controls the logging.
       Reconstructed image execution events can also be (very rarely) caused by
       dropped audit events; this option does not affect those.
       Because of the limited value and quality of reconstructed image
       execution events, disabling this suppression is not recommended.
